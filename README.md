<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

TutorNet is the reservation-based system for tutoring lessons. The idea of the project is to give visitors ability to make a reservation within seconds - without the need for an exhausting regstration process.

The future objective of development is to give users the ability to verify their reservation with a code message sent to their phone or email.

## Current Stage of Development

At the moment, there is only one tutor in the database. Furthermore, there is only a reservation view of an already chosen tutor, without a "search through tutors" page. Project's target is a web app with multiple tutors, each having their own reservation dashboards.
